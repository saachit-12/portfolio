# Changes Made

After receiving user feedback these are the following changes I made to the project
  - I changed the title of the story to be more focussed on the US, since all the visualizations are 
  - I replaced the map with a Tree Map, which is more intuitive about the % of GDP of Health Care for a subset of countries than a geographical heat map for scattered countries.
