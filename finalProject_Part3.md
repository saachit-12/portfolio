# Changes Made

After receiving user feedback these are the following changes I made to the project
  - I changed the title of the story to be more focussed on the US, since all the visualizations are 
  - I replaced the map with a Tree Map, which is more intuitive about the % of GDP of Health Care for a subset of countries than a geographical heat map for scattered countries.
  - I highlighted Italy, Sweden and USA as opposed to all the countries in the Trend Line Map for Social Spending Across Countries
  - I gave my call to action more content.
  - Added a reference page at the end of my story.
  - Edited axes titles of the first graph to be more concise and intuitve.
  - Edited Tool tips to be more descriptive.
  
 
 # Design Decisions:
 
 - Most of my visuals are graphs that can easily compare  metrics between Countries
 - I chose Tableau to do my visualizations as it is a more powerful tool to modify the data for a visual with DAX expressions and conditional statements.
 - I chose to use Side-By-Side layout on ShortHand so that each visual has helper text, or an insight.
 - The colors I primarily chose for the visuals were warm - orange, yellow and brown. I chose them because they can be considered neutral colors for Government   Expenditure.
