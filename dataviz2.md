 Comparing the visuals 2 and 3, the 2nd visual has static components whereas the 3rd visual allows the viewer to filter the Debt to GDP ratio by year.
 The grid of line charts gives the user an idea of how a country Debt is over time, where as the single line chart gives the viewer a comparision between different countries for a given year. The ideas portrayed are different. From a visual perspective I feel the single line chart is less crowded and seeing the data points on the chart gives the veiwer a quick idea of what the chart represents.
