# Outline

<p> 
  The topic I have chosen for the TSWD final project is Analyzing Central Government Expenditure Behavior across countires.
  By measuring a country's central government expenditure as a % of its GDP we can compare spending trends between countries.

Project Structure:

a) Story brief

b) Comparing Countries with the Highest GDP (Top 10)

c) Government Spending as a % of GDP in 2020 (Top 5)

d) Analyzing Government Spending Behavior in the Health Care overtime  -  Devloping vs Developed Country (eg. India Vs USA)

e) Analyzing Social Government Spending Behavior.

f) Interesting facts from Data.

# Method and Medium

The final project will be built using digital story creator short-hand.  I will build the visualizations using a combination of Tableau and Flourish.
The first two graphs related to the GDP and Government Spending will set context to the point being made - a countrywise comparision of spending behaviors between countires.
