Final feedback

Interview 3 users U1, U2 and U3. Here is the feedback below.

## Cumulative User Feedback (some changes shall be implemented in final deliverable)

Q1. Overaching view of title page - U1 and U3 expected a sort of comparision with USA and other countries expenditure. U2 thinks the backgroud image is misleading.
Thinks that it should focus on USA, as stated in the title. (I changed the background image based on U3's feedback)
Q2. U1,U2 and U3 clearly understand Chart 1 ranks the top 10 nations by GDP in 2019. U1 thinks that the text next to the chart can be more descriptive.
Q3. All Users agree that the Bar chart as a choice is simple. U1 thinks that the chart can look neater with labels and axes displayed fully.
Q4. U1 and U2 don't mind the color palette as there is no specific color that comes to mind when you think of Government Expenditure, U3 suggests a cool color like blue to be the theme of the graphs.
Q5. U1 and U2 think that the title of Chart 2 explains what the chart is about (position of USA in % of GDP spent on Government Expenses), however U3 wants more of a description in the side text. U3 thinks time filed (year) should be present, or state when the data was taken.
Q6. All 3 users appreciate the use of the bubble, explanation in side text is effective
Q7. U1 and U2 don't mind the color palette as there is no specific color that comes to mind when you think of Government Expenditure, U3 suggests a cool color like blue to be the theme of the graphs.
Q8. All three users agree that the title of Chart 3 relays that it showing countrywise trendlines of Social Expenses made by the government. The side text helps the user to understand the two counties being compared.
However unanimous feedback is that only Italy and USA should be highlighted. (This change has been implemented)
Q9. U1, U2, U3 agree with the chart choice.
Q10.U1 and U2 don't mind the color palette as there is no specific color that comes to mind when you think of Government Expenditure, U3 suggests a cool color like blue to be the theme of the graphs.
Q11. All users agree that although the title of the graph explains what is trying to be depicted in the map (Health Care Expenditure as a % of GDP), the map itself is one-toned and needs to be better differentiated. All users agree that the side-text does add some context.
Q12. U2 suggests replacing the map with a table.
Q13. U1 and U2 don't mind the color palette as there is no specific color that comes to mind when you think of Government Expenditure, U3 suggests a cool color like blue to be the theme of the graphs.

Final Feedback: All users like the black and white theme used on Short Hand.n U1 feels that the text in the storyboard needs to be consistent with the word "social" and not use public as well. U2, U3 feel that the call to action needs to be more fleshed out.
